# Quickdraw-google
Here we have a simple version of google quickdraw on python 

First we train a CNN model with quickdraw dataset. Not all dataset but just with 50000.(main data set has 50 milion images to train) Then after train our model i made a simple GUI
to draw paint and then our model predict it. If you try this you see this have good accuracy indeed we train on small dataset. you can make it better in model and in GUI This is too simple to do that! You can find main paper to work more [HERE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03477).
